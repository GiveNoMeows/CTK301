    <p><a href="#" target="_blank">This is a link.</a> I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.</p>
    <p><a href="#" target="_blank">This is a link.</a> there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.</p>

        <p>As it is stated in the Declaration of Independence, “a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.” Although not separating, the employees of this Subway demand a change, and deem it reasonable to do so. The employees of this Subway are extremely dissatisfied with the unpleasant work conditions, unprofessional management, and unsatisfactory wages.
